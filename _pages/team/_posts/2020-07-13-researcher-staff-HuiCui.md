 I joined La Trobe University as a Lecturer in Interactive Digital Media in March 2019.

I received my PhD and MPhil degrees in Computer Science with specialization in Medical Image Computing at The University of Sydney, Australia in 2016 and 2013 under the supervision of Prof David Dagan Feng, A/Prof Xiuying Wang and Clinical Professor Michael Fulham. I also worked closely with Dr Jianlong Zhou from UTS in graph topology. I obtained my Bachelor of Engineering degree from Harbin Institute of Technology (China C9 University) in 2011.

Before joining La Trobe University, I was a Research Fellow at BIomedical and Multimedia Information Technology Research Group (BMIT), The University of Sydney, between 2016 and 2018.
