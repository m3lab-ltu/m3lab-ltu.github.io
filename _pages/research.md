# Research

Our research focuses on digital media, interactive design, and creative visualisation. The research directions include: Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality; Human-Computer Interaction; Image Analysis; Computer Graphics; Computer Vision. In particular, we exploit the latest techniques of Artificial Intelligence and design thinking approaches for the research projects 

Our works have been accepted and published in prestigious conferences and top-tier journals, mainly in :
Prestigeous conference: 
* IEEE ISMAR, IEEE VR; ACM CHI, ACM SIGGRAPH, ACM SIGGRAPH Asia; ACM CHI;

Prestigeous journal:
* ACM TOG, ACM TOCHI; IEEE TVCG;  

We have been actively participating into the research community events, and serving as steering committee members, conference chairs and program committee members in conferences, such as:
* IEEE ISMAR, IEEE VR; ACM SIGGRAPH Asia; ACM VRST, ACM CHI
