# Research

Our research focuses on digital media, interactive design, and creative visualisation. The research directions include: Virtual, Augmented and Mixed Reality; Human-Computer Interaction; Image Analysis; Computer Graphics; Computer Vision.

In particular, we exploit the latest techniques of Artificial Intelligence and design thinking approaches for the research projects related to:
* Digital culurtral Heritage 
* Visualization of Complex Scientific and Social Data;
* Interactive Biomedical Image Analysis;
* Multi-model User Interface Design; and
* Computational Urban and Architectural Layout Design.

Our works have been accepted and published in prestigious conferences and top-tier journals, mainly in :
Prestigeous conference: 
* IEEE ISMAR, IEEE VR; ACM CHI, ACM SIGGRAPH, ACM SIGGRAPH Asia; ACM CHI;

Prestigeous journal:
* ACM TOG, ACM TOCHI; IEEE TVCG;  

We have been actively participating into the research community events, and serving as steering committee members, conference chairs and program committee members in conferences, such as:
* IEEE ISMAR, IEEE VR; ACM SIGGRAPH Asia; ACM VRST, ACM CHI
